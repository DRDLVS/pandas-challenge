# Pandas Challenge

## Overview 
As chief data scientist for my school district i present analyisis and conclusions about school budgets, priorities and trends that can make a better decition making.


## Analysis 
* There are more students passing reading than math
* Cabrera high school, the best.
* Excluding Thomas high shchool every school with a budget per student lower than $609 has an overall passing above 89% it looks like a trend in which if the budget per student is higher the overall passing is lower
* all schools belonging to a charter school type have an overall passing above 89%


## Conclusion
1. Should look into why schools with higher budget are getting worse grades. (Are privileged students taking education for granted? are they not putting the same effort as students that value money, efforts and the importance of a good education?)
2. Schools that have less than 2000 students have an overall passing above 89%, why is that? are schools with higher student count harder to manage? should there be only shcools below 2000 students?
